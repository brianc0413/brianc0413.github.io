I'm a Ph.D student at Cornell University, broadly interested in causal inference, machine learning interpretability, and applications in high-risk domains such as healthcare and policy. Previously, I was a research assistant for the Tobin Economics Research Program, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Yale's Department of Statistics and Data Science. I've also held interdisciplinary opportunities through the [Information Society Project](https://law.yale.edu/brian-cho).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brianc0413/brianc0413.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
